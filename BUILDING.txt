SETTING UP CALZONE'S BUILD ENVIRONMENT

To build Calzone you'll need to copy the TeamCity 5 API jar's to the lib
directory.  These jars aren't in source control because they're not freely
(as in speech) redistributable.

	devPackage/common-api.jar
	devPackage/runtime-util.jar
	devPackage/server-api.jar
